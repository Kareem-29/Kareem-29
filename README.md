Hi, I'm AbdulKareem â€” a passionate Front-end Web Developer with a strong foundation in Back-end Development, UX/UI Design, and Data Analysis.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on a wide range of projects â€” from commissioned work to personal passion projects â€” and Iâ€™m excited to share my journey with you. My interests span across Web Development, UX/UI, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning. I thrive on solving problems through design and code, and Iâ€™m always exploring new technologies to stay ahead of the curve.
